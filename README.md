\# YouTube Comment Emotion Analyzer







\*\*\[Live Demo Link Here]\*\* <!-- We'll get this in the next step -->



\## üöÄ Project Description

A full-stack web application that analyzes the emotional tone of YouTube comments in real-time. Users can input a YouTube video URL, and the application fetches the latest comments, performs a deep contextual analysis using a state-of-the-art AI model, and visualizes the results as an interactive radar chart.



\## The Journey: From Simple Sentiment to Deep Emotion

This project was an iterative journey in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

\* \*\*V1 (Basic Sentiment):\*\* Initially, the app used `TextBlob`, a simple library for positive/negative sentiment. However, it failed to understand context and slang (e.g., classifying "this song is fire" as negative).

\* \*\*V2 (Emotion Model):\*\* I upgraded the backend to use a Transformer-based emotion classification model. This was more accurate but still struggled with modern, informal language.

\* \*\*V3 (State-of-the-Art):\*\* The final version uses a \*\*RoBERTa model trained specifically on millions of tweets\*\*. This model excels at understanding slang, sarcasm, and the cultural context of online comments, providing a highly accurate emotional profile of the audience. This evolution demonstrates a deep understanding of choosing the right tool for a specific NLP task.
